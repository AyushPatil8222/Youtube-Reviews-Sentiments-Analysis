It involves data collection, text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and visualization. This project can be applied to brand monitoring, content analysis, community engagement, and recommendation systems, providing valuable insights into public opinion and user behavior on YouTube.

Key Features:
1.Data Collection: Gathering YouTube comments from specific videos or channels.
2.Text Preprocessing: Cleaning and normalizing the text data, including tasks like removing stop words, stemming, and lemmatization.
3.Feature Extraction: Creating numerical representations of the text data.
4.Model Training: Building a machine learning model (bert model) using labeled training data to classify comments based on their sentiment.
5.Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy.
6.Visualization: Presenting the results in a visually appealing manner, such as using word clouds or bar charts to illustrate the distribution of sentiments.
