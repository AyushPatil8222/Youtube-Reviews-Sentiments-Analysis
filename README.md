The YouTube Comment Sentiment Analysis project utilizes NLTK to classify comments as positive, negative, or neutral. It involves data collection, text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and visualization. This project can be applied to brand monitoring, content analysis, community engagement, and recommendation systems, providing valuable insights into public opinion and user behavior on YouTube.
Key Features:

1.Data Collection: Gathering YouTube comments from specific videos or channels.
2.Text Preprocessing: Cleaning and normalizing the text data, including tasks like removing stop words, stemming, and lemmatization.
3.Feature Extraction: Creating numerical representations of the text data, such as using bag-of-words or TF-IDF techniques.
4.Model Training: Building a machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest) using labeled training data to classify comments based on their sentiment.
5.Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6.Visualization: Presenting the results in a visually appealing manner, such as using word clouds or bar charts to illustrate the distribution of sentiments.
